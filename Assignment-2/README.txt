Step 1: Run all of the cells in order top to bottom in the 'highlighting_problems.py' file. 
- This file generates all of the meta-data necessary for the charts file
- Note: This file does generate the learning curves for the final ANN models and the various algos, 
        thought this would be easier for you :)
- Note: The learning curves might look a little different as I wasn't able to find a way to set a seed for this function. But nothing too drastic. 


Step 2: Run all of the cells top to bottom in the 'make_charts.py' file
- This file will produce all of the charts. 

That's it, pretty simple this time.
